# 4x4-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a twist: it's played on a 4x4 grid! This project allows two users to play against each other, selecting their symbols (X or O), and highlights the winning line before resetting the game for a new round.

# Features
4x4 Grid: A larger grid for a more challenging game.
Two-Player Mode: Allows two users to play against each other.
Symbol Selection: Users can choose their symbol (X or O) before the game starts.
Winning Line Highlight: Highlights the winning line for a short duration before resetting the game.
Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the game.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.

# How to Play
Open the game in a web browser.
Select your symbol (X or O).
Take turns clicking on the grid to place your symbol.
The first player to align four of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
The winning line is highlighted, and the game resets after a short delay.
