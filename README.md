# 4x4-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a twist: it's played on a 4x4 grid! This project allows two users to play against each other, selecting their symbols (X or O), and highlights the winning line before resetting the game for a new round.

## Features

- **4x4 Grid**: A larger grid for a more challenging game.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two users to play against each other.
- **Symbol Selection**: Users can choose their symbol (X or O) before the game starts.
- **Winning Line Highlight**: Highlights the winning line for a short duration before resetting the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Select your symbol (X or O).
3. Take turns clicking on the grid to place your symbol.
4. The first player to align four of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
5. The winning line is highlighted, and the game resets after a short delay.
