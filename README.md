# 4x4-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a twist: it's played on a 4x4 grid! This project allows two users to play against each other, selecting their symbols (X or O), and highlights the winning line before resetting the game for a new round.

## Features

- **4x4 Grid**: A larger grid for a more challenging game.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two users to play against each other.
- **Winning Line Highlight**: Highlights the winning line for a short duration before resetting the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Take turns clicking on the grid to place your symbol.
3. The first player to align four of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. The winning line is highlighted, and the game resets after a short delay.
